# This function updates and upgrades all packages on a system running apt
function auto-update {
  # Check if the user has root privileges
  if [[ $EUID -eq 0 ]]; then
    # Update the package list and upgrade all packages
    apt update && apt upgrade -y
    # Remove any orphaned packages
    apt autoremove -y

    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt autoremove -y && sudo autoclean -y

Note: This function will only work on systems that use apt as the package manager, such as Ubuntu and Debian. 
Other Linux distributions may use different package managers, such as yum on Red Hat-based systems and dnf on Fedora-based systems.
